"""This module currently provides alternative implementations for two
functions in Python's itertools and functools modules, respectively.

The alternative implementations can be used as drop-in replacements, however,
potentially enhancing the performance when used in secure computations. More
specifically, these implementations are aimed at reducing the overall round
complexity, possible at the expense of increasing overall space complexity,
time complexity, and communication complexity.
