Suppose we have generated $x = [0,0,1,0]$ as a secret unit vector of length $4$ (which should happen with probability 25%). Given $x$, we will output either $[0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]$ or $[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]$ with 50% probability each, depending on a secret random bit. This way we are able to double the length at the expense of one secret random bit.\n",

Also, we see that $x-y = x$ if $b=0$ and $x-y = [0,0,0,0]$ if $b=1$. The correct output is thus obtained by taking the concatenation of $y$ and $x-y$.\n",

Instead, we recursively generate a random unit vector $x$ of length $m=(n+1)/2$. As before, we also generate a random bit $b$. Altogether, we thus get $2 m = n+1$ equally likely values for $b$ and $x$ jointly. Since our target is a uniformly random unit vector of length $n$, we need to reject one out of the $2m$ possible values for $b$ and $x$. Below we choose to reject in case $b=1$ and $x[0]=1$.\n",

We also set the default bit length to $l=10$, which is large enough for our examples anyway. The default length of $l=10$ is now used because we use secure integers of type `mpc.SecInt()`; for secure integers of type `mpc.SecInt(32)`, say, changing $l$ has no effect."
